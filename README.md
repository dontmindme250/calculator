# Enhanced JavaScript Calculator

This project is an advanced calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It retains the functionality of a basic calculator but also incorporates scientific operations for a more comprehensive utility. 

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Scientific operations including:
  - Sine (`sin`), Cosine (`cos`), and Tangent (`tan`)
  - Square root (`sqrt`)
  - Power (`^`)
  - Fraction (`1/x`)
- Clear display functionality
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Support for both mouse click and keyboard input for operations

## Usage

To perform calculations, you can click on the buttons of the calculator or type directly using your keyboard. 

For scientific operations, enter the number first, then click the corresponding function button. For example, for calculating the sine of 45, enter `45`, then click `sin`. To calculate \(2^3\), input `2`, then `^`, followed by `3`, and then hit `=`.

## Enhancements

- The calculator now supports floating-point arithmetic for more precise calculations.
- Error handling has been improved to ensure that invalid operations are gracefully managed, displaying an "Error" message.

### Note

This project aims at providing a simple yet powerful calculator for educational purposes and daily use. Suggestions and contributions to further enhance its capabilities are welcome.
